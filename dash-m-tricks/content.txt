If you call python from the command line using the --help option, you'll see a number of other curious options:

```
$ python --help
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-b     : issue warnings about str(bytes_instance), str(bytearray_instance)
         and comparing bytes/bytearray with str. (-bb: issue errors)
-B     : don't write .pyc files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : debug output from parser; also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
-I     : isolate Python from the user's environment (implies -E and -s)
-m mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list)
-O     : optimize generated bytecode slightly; also PYTHONOPTIMIZE=x

... and so forth ...
```

Personally, I like the -m option. The "m" stands for modules as in running modules in Python's path as scripts themselves. Some things you can do with it may make you think the "m" option stands for magic :-).

One cool thing you can do is to open very quickly an http server for a particular directory. Especially if you have something in it that you would like to quickly share with someone on your network.

Here's how you can do this:

```python
# For Python 3.x:

$ python -m http.server

or if you're using Python 2.x:

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Another cool module is the "timeit" module. So cool in fact, I wrote another article on that subject [here](/post/python-using-timeit-module-quick-speed-evaluations/). It can, of course, be run inside your scripts but it can also be run using the -m option:

```
$ python -m timeit -c "[n * n for n in range(1000)]"
10000 loops, best of 3: 65.5 usec per loop

$ python -m timeit -c "[n * n for n in range(1000)]"
10000 loops, best of 3: 66.1 usec per loop
```

Were you aware you could write your own simple tests for functions by putting the tests into the function's documentation?

Here, you can use the doctest module and -m option to test your function:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python


def my_func(a, b=2):
    """
    >>> my_func(5)
    10
    >>> my_func(5, 3)
    15
    >>> my_func('Hello')
    'HelloHello'
    """
    return a * b
```

Then call python -m like so (note that the -v gives you more output):

```
$ python -m doctest -v demo1.py 
Trying:
    my_func(5)
Expecting:
    10
ok
Trying:
    my_func(5, 3)
Expecting:
    15
ok
Trying:
    my_func('Hello')
Expecting:
    'HelloHello'
ok
1 items had no tests:
    demo1
1 items passed all tests:
   3 tests in demo1.my_func
3 tests in 2 items.
3 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
```

Another cool usage is using the markdown module. I am including a sample markdown file called, appropriately enough, "sample_markdown.txt". The file's contents are as follows:

```
# Welcome To Sample Markdown!

## This is a smaller header

This is a paragraph. Typically, when you can't think of anything to write but you need to test out some formatting, it's a good idea to use some "lorem ipsum":

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc pharetra dapibus semper. Aenean eget velit tristique, tincidunt arcu sed, malesuada nibh. Maecenas sed gravida ipsum. Morbi diam turpis, porttitor quis quam ut, fermentum ullamcorper augue. 

Duis feugiat enim a nibh porttitor consequat. Nulla at purus eget ante scelerisque tempus id id massa. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. *Praesent* sollicitudin iaculis finibus. Phasellus quis pretium nulla. Sed lectus felis, vehicula vitae lectus a, hendrerit volutpat nibh. _Nulla eu ullamcorper mi, sit amet porta orci._ Cras dictum est aliquam turpis egestas blandit.

Here is a list of some ipsum words:

* Donec 
* congue
* quam 
* nec 

Ok, this is the end.
```

The markdown library does not come with Python out of the box but can be downloaded and installed in your Python environment:

```
$ pip install markdown
```

And then we can use the following command to generate some html from our markdown file:

```
python -m markdown sample_markdown.txt

<h1>Welcome To Sample Markdown!</h1>
<h2>This is a smaller header</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph. Typically, when you can't think of anything to write but you need to test out some formatting, it's a good idea to use some "lorem ipsum":</p>

<li>congue</li>

<li>nec </li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, this is the end.</p>
```

I like using it to generate static html files. Pretty cool, isn't it?

I would challenge to go around to many of the modules that come with Python out of the box and test them with the -m option. You will probably find a lot of unexpected things.
