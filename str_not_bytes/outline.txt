Problem

Python 3 handles strings differently.

2 different types:

Byte

Str

In Python 3 doing a read from stdout and stdin for subprocess now has been changed from str to byte. Python has no way of knowing which type of encoding is being passed.

Possible to convert str to bytes and bytes to str.

The str of old is not backward compatible any longer

Explicitly defining unicode types is now the way to go.

String now supports unicode.

Example - Django using __str__ instead of __unicode__ when using Python 3.
